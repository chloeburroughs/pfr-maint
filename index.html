          A note from our editors</h6>
          <!-- <h1>Down for ‚ú®Maintenance‚ú®</h1>
          <p>We thought about putting in a fail whale, but we don&rsquo;t want Elon Musk to try and buy us. We have enough tech issues.</p>
          <h4>Other stuff you can do while we&rsquo;re down&hellip;</h4> -->
          <p>Dear Readers,<br />
          Pork Fried Rice Zine started as a small way to discuss the issues of our time. Concerns often shouted down by those with the power to do so, distracted from by ‚Äúcapital‚Äù and ‚Äúbull markets‚Äù and ‚Äúinvestor equity‚Äù. Extinguished by those sworn to protect, while streets were renamed and temporarily painted, sweeping our trepidations under the rug. This isn&rsquo;t new. The protests against the genocide in Gaza mirroring our parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; protests of Vietnam, both actions with bipartisan support of our leaders. Labor organizing has, since America&rsquo;s inception, been met with powerful and violent resistance from power, and labor&rsquo;s ‚Äústrides‚Äù have been incremental at best. This isn&rsquo;t the American Dream, but it&rsquo;s always been the American Way.</p>
          <p>PFR was founded during the COVID lockdown, as pestilence was denied while it ran rampant among the front lines of America&rsquo;s communities. We, on a small way, too small a way, tried to shine a light on our concerns in hopes we would learn and grow and do better.</p>
          <p>A few nights ago, we learned that so many Americans, too many, have not learned or grown or done better. They have sided with the self-interest of fascistic power. They have chosen the remote possibility of slightly lower gas and grocery bills over the rights and protection of women, minorities, LGBTQIA+ community, and so many others.</p>
          <p>Today, we&rsquo;re working behind the scenes to bring PFR back, and make it bigger. It&rsquo;s not enough to make art and write poetry and prose. We must do those things, as they are fundamental reflections of our humanity, but we must work so much harder and go so much farther.</p>
          <p>We&rsquo;re bringing our entire back-catalog online soon, ad-free and paywall-free. But we&rsquo;re also going to spend this next presidential term building mutual aid networks, enabling critical whistleblowers, spotlighting the damaging actions of those in power, and partnering with those that share these missions. We will persist. We will survive. We will, in the words of our queer activist for parents, ACT UP and FIGHT.</p>
          <p>I urge you to join us, either behind the banner of PFR, or with another organization or communities with similar goals.</p>
          <p>Fuck fascism, racism, sexism, queerphobia, and transphobia. Fuck Trump, and fuck Project 2025. We are the people, and we are fucking enraged. We are the people, and our rage is our best chance at survival.</p>
